Abstract:
Presentation deals with new graphical user interface for composing hardcopy map outputs in GRASS GIS. New GUI was developed within my bachelor project.
Hardcopy maps are created by module ps.map which requires a text file with
instructions. New graphical interface allows to compose maps interactively to make it more comfortable for users. GUI implements most of the ps.map functionality
and it is developed with the GUI toolkit wxPython.
